#Hello from Progress Report 
progress report is a forever work in progress app that allows artists, big or small, to track their progress , use timers , and more. progress report is meant to be lightweight, somewhat functional, and most importantly community geared.

This project is by Atiyah B. Ellerbee for Eleven Fifty's Red Badge PERN project. The client portion's github repo is [here] (https://github.com/spaclyn/prClient).

#Troubleshooting
trying to add your own take on this code? trying to figure out this intricate web of spaghetti? if all else fails try running

```npm install```

hopefully adds a nice layer of ducktape!
